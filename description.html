            The **HASBULA BORGIR** game is a fun and challenging memory activity where players must recreate burgers by selecting the correct sequence of ingredients based on a preview image. At the start of each round, a burger design is briefly displayed, showing the layers of ingredients such as meat, cheese, tomato, lettuce, onion, pickles, and sauce, along with the top and bottom buns. Your goal is to memorize the exact order of these ingredients, as the preview disappears after a short time, leaving you to rely on your memory to reconstruct the burger. Using an on-screen panel with buttons for each ingredient, you must carefully select each item in the correct order to build an identical burger. Accuracy is crucial, as once you add an ingredient, you cannot remove it, meaning any mistakes could make it impossible to recreate the burger correctly. There is no scoring system, but the challenge level is randomly generated, with some designs being simple and others featuring more complex or layered combinations of ingredients. As you progress, this randomness keeps the game exciting, requiring sharp observation, quick recall, and adaptability. This game is not only entertaining but also an excellent exercise for memory, focus, and hand-eye coordination, making it a delightful mental workout.
